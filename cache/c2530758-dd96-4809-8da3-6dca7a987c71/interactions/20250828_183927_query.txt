CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Respond only in JSON format
2. Break this down into the smallest possible verified steps
3. Your 'nextStep' must be a SPECIFIC EXECUTABLE ACTION, not a description
4. If you need to download a repository, use GitHubDownloader tool
5. If you need to analyze file sizes, use FileSystemAnalyzer tool  
6. If you need to read code content, use CodeAnalyzer tool
7. Consider what could go wrong at each step
8. Use tools when you need to verify information
9. Never assume anything works without verification

FIRST STEP GUIDANCE:
- For repository analysis: Start with "Use GitHubDownloader tool to download the repository from [URL]"
- For file analysis: Start with "Use FileSystemAnalyzer tool to analyze the downloaded repository structure"
- For code reading: Start with "Use CodeAnalyzer tool to read and analyze [specific file]"
